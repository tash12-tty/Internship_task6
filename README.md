## To create password and then check the strength of the password using password strength tools ##
Passwords, in this digital era are very cricual part of our privacy. We are loading huge amounts of data over the internet due to which attackers have the chance to manipulate the data or even steal sensative information. For protecting our privacy, we use password for authentication. 
But the problem with us humans is that we like to keep things straight and simple. So we choose such passwords which are very easy and remember and as a result, very easy for the crackers to crack it. 

In this task, I have created a password and checked it against password cracking tools which helped me strengthen my password.

## Best practices to crack strong password ##
1. Brute Force Attack
Trying every possible combination of characters (a, aa, aaa … Zz1!@ etc.).
Very time-consuming for long, complex passwords.
Defense: Use long passwords (12+ characters), mix of upper/lowercase, numbers, symbols.

2. Dictionary Attack
Attackers use a pre-compiled list of common passwords (like 123456, qwerty, password123).
Faster than brute force because it skips unlikely guesses.
Defense: Avoid dictionary words, add randomness.

3. Hybrid Attack
Combination of dictionary + brute force.
Example: If your password is Password2025!, attacker tries dictionary words + numbers/symbols.
Defense: Don’t just add "123" or your birth year after a common word.

4. Credential Stuffing
Using leaked username-password pairs from past data breaches.
Example: If your email/password was leaked from one website, attackers try the same combo on other sites.
Defense: Use different passwords for different accounts + enable 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication).

5. Phishing & Social Engineering
Tricking users into revealing their password (fake login page, emails, calls).
Defense: Educate users, look out for suspicious links.

6. Keylogging & Malware
Malware installed on your system records keystrokes, including passwords.
Defense: Keep devices updated, use antivirus, avoid unknown downloads.

## Best practices to create strong password ##
1. Length Over Complexity : Aim for 12–16+ characters minimum.Longer passwords are much harder to crack than short complex ones.

2. Mix character types :
Use a combination of:
Uppercase (A–Z)
Lowercase (a–z)
Numbers (0–9)
Symbols (! @ # $ % ^ & *)

3. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA/2FA) : Even if someone guesses your password, 2FA adds another lock.Use authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy) instead of SMS when possible.

4. Avoid Personal Information : Don’t include names, birthdays, phone numbers, or simple patterns. Attackers try these first during brute force or dictionary attacks.

5. Use Passphrases : Combine random, unrelated words with symbols and numbers.Easier to remember, hard to crack.
Example: Sunset_Coffee#Rocket^89

6. Regularly Update Critical Passwords : Especially for emails, banking, and work accounts.Rotate them every 3–6 months or after a security breach.
