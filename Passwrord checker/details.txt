** Tool used : PasswordMonstor **
The password checker checks for the following characters in the password-
- An uppercase
- A lowercase
- Characters or symbols (%,$,@,!, etc)
- Number
- Space or underscore

If all these  parameters are given, then it also check for the arrangment of the characters. Then analyzes the given password and then gives the result.
Like in this case, I have given a simple random password **Computer$123#**. It is showing me **weak** and an estimated time to crack it and some remarks as well.
So I just reverse the word to **Retpumoc$123#**, and its showing me strong password and also the estimated time to crack it.
This is how arrangment of characters also affects the strength of a password.
